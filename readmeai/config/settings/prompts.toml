_file_summary = """
You are a highly skilled Staff Software Engineering leader with extensive knowledge across various tech stacks. Your task is to write a concise and informative summary for a specific file within an open-source project's codebase.

First, review the overall project structure:

<project_structure>
{{project_structure}}
</project_structure>

Now, focus on the specific file to be summarized:

<file_path>
{{file_path}}
</file_path>

Here's the content of the file:

<file_content>
{{file_content}}
</file_content>

Your goal is to provide a succinct summary that highlights the main purpose and use of this file in relation to the entire codebase architecture. Focus on what the code achieves, avoiding technical implementation details.

Before writing the final summary, please analyze the file and its context by performing the following steps inside <file_analysis> tags:

1. Identify the primary function or purpose of the file.
2. Determine how this file relates to or interacts with other parts of the codebase.
3. List the key features or functionalities implemented in this file.
4. Consider how this file contributes to the overall project architecture.
5. Identify any important dependencies or relationships with other components.
6. Note key classes, functions, or methods defined in the file.
7. Assess the file's potential impact on the project's performance or scalability.
8. Highlight any unique or innovative approaches used in the implementation.

Now, based on your analysis, write a summary of the file that meets the following criteria:
1. Length: 50-70 words
2. Start with a verb or noun (avoid phrases like "This file", "The file", "This code", etc.)
3. Focus on the file's main purpose and its role in the codebase
4. Avoid technical implementation details
5. Use clear and concise language

Present your final summary within <summary> tags.

Example output structure (using generic content):

<summary>
Implements core authentication functionality for the application. Manages user login, logout, and session handling processes. Integrates with the database module for user verification and token storage. Provides essential security features, including password hashing and protection against common authentication vulnerabilities. Serves as a critical component in maintaining application security and user management.

logo = """
Create a fun and vibrant app icon logo for a GitHub repository.
The logo should be in the style of an Apple app icon - square with rounded corners.
The icon should feature a singular, memorable character or object that represents the essence of the project, without any external background.

=== CONTEXT ===
PROJECT NAME: {project_name}
PROJECT OVERVIEW: {project_overview}
PROJECT tagline: {project_tagline}

=== INSTRUCTION ===
1. Central Character: [Describe a relevant animal, mythical creature, tool, or object that relates to the project theme]. This character should be stylized and appealing, with a playful yet professional look.
2. Color Scheme: Use colors that reflect the project's theme and complement the central character. The colors should be vibrant and eye-catching.
3. Style: Modern, slightly cartoonish, and memorable. The design should be simple enough to be recognizable at small sizes, but with enough detail to be interesting when viewed larger.
4. Layout: The central character or object should fill most of the square space, leaving some room for subtle elements or patterns that hint at the project's purpose or field.
5. Text (Optional): If including text, limit it to a short acronym or simple logo type that integrates well with the visual elements.
6. Background: The icon itself should have a solid or gradient background color that's part of the overall design. Do not include any external background beyond the rounded square of the icon.
7. Originality: Ensure the design is original and doesn't infringe on any existing copyrights or trademarks.

Please describe the icon design in detail, focusing on the central character, color scheme, and any additional elements within the icon itself. Do not describe any elements outside of the rounded square app icon shape.
"""

_overview = """
You are tasked with analyzing a codebase and providing a concise overview of the software project. Your goal is to create a brief paragraph that captures the project's core use-case, value proposition, and target audience without delving into technical details.

You will be provided with two pieces of information:
1. The project name: <project_name>{0}</project_name>
2. A summary of the project's files: <file_summaries>{1}</file_summaries>

To complete this task, follow these steps:
1. Carefully review the project name and file summaries to understand the project's purpose and structure.
2. Identify the core use-case, value proposition, and target audience based on the information provided.
3. Craft a concise paragraph that elegantly presents these key aspects of the project.

Your response should adhere to the following guidelines:
- Focus on the project's core use-case and value proposition without including technical details.
- Exclude technical jargon, code snippets, implementation specifics, quotes, and links.
- Limit your response to a maximum of 50 words.

Present your final overview within <overview> tags. Here's an example of a well-structured response:

<example>
<overview>
README-AI is a developer tool that automatically generates comprehensive README files for software projects. It streamlines documentation creation across all technical disciplines, offering customization options and supporting multiple languages. This tool aims to improve consistency and efficiency in project documentation for developers of all experience levels.
</overview>
</example>

Now, please analyze the provided project information and generate a concise overview following the guidelines above.
"""

overview = """
You are a skilled technical writer tasked with creating an engaging and concise introduction for a developer tool. Your goal is to capture the essence of the tool and highlight its key features in a way that appeals to a technical audience.

Here's the information about the tool you'll be describing:

Project Name: {0}
Source Code Summaries: {1}

Please generate a concise and engaging introduction for this developer tool, following these guidelines:

1. Structure:
   - Begin with a brief description of the tool (1-2 sentences).
   - Follow with a "Why [TOOL NAME]?" section.
   - List 4-6 key benefits or features as bullet points.

2. Content:
   - Keep the entire introduction brief, around 150 words.
   - Highlight the main benefits and features of the tool.
   - Ensure the content is relevant to a technical audience (developers).

3. Style:
   - Use colored emojis as prefixes for the bullet points in the feature list.
   - Randomize the emoji choices, but keep their shape/color logically consistent and symmetrically aligned.
   - Use bold text for emphasis where appropriate.

4. Formatting:
   Present your response in the following format only including the introduction between the <overview tags:
   <overview>
   [Brief description of the project]

   **Why [project_name]?**

   This project [main goal or purpose]. The core features include:

   - **[Emoji] [Feature 1]:** [Brief explanation]
   - **[Emoji] [Feature 2]:** [Brief explanation]
   [Continue for 4-6 features total]

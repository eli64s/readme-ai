## Help Menus

The `--help` flag can be used to view the help menu for a command, e.g., for `readmeai`:

```console
❯ readmeai --help
```

## Viewing the Version

When seeking help, it's important to determine the version of readmeai that you're using — sometimes the
problem is already solved in a newer version.

To check the installed version:

```console
❯ readmeai --version
```

The following are also valid:

```console
❯ readmeai -V
❯ readmeai pip --version
```

## Open an issue on GitHub

and request features. Make sure to search for similar issues first, as it is common for someone else
to encounter the same problem.

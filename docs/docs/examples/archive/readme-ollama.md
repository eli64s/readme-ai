| [git.py](https://github.com/eli64s/readme-ai/blob/master/readmeai/services/git.py)           | This Python module, located at readmeai/services/git.py, handles Git operations for cloning and validating repositories. It includes functions to clone a repository into a temporary directory and remove hidden files and directories. Additionally, it contains utility functions for fetching API and file URLs from Git service repositories and finding the path to the Git executable. |
| [metadata.py](https://github.com/eli64s/readme-ai/blob/master/readmeai/services/metadata.py) | The `metadata.py` file in the `readmeai/services` directory processes GitHub repository metadata from Git host providers using helper methods. It utilizes `aiohttp` to fetch data via API requests, converts raw repository data into a `RepositoryMetadata` dataclass, and returns an instance of this dataclass containing parsed metadata.                                                |

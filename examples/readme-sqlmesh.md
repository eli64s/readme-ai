## 📍 Overview

The sqlmesh-test-tools project is designed to enhance the reliability and efficiency of SQL data models within the SQLMesh framework. It features tools for generating both synthetic datasets and YAML configuration files, which are crucial for automating SQL unit tests. By parsing and executing SQL queries, and then validating these against generated datasets, the project supports comprehensive testing workflows. This setup not only streamlines the development process but also ensures the accuracy and robustness of SQL queries and data models, making it an invaluable asset for developers working with complex data-driven applications.

## 👾 Features

|    | Feature            | Description |
|----|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️  | **Architecture**   | Modular design with separate components for dataset generation, YAML configuration, and SQL testing. Utilizes Jupyter notebooks for configuration and data generation scripts. |
| 🔩 | **Code Quality**   | Code is structured with clear separation of concerns. Uses Python best practices and adheres to PEP8 standards, facilitated by tools like `flake8` and `black`. |
| 📄 | **Documentation**  | Documentation is embedded within code and Jupyter notebooks, explaining functionalities and usage. Lacks a comprehensive README or external documentation. |
| 🔌 | **Integrations**   | Integrates with SQLMesh for SQL testing, DuckDB for database interactions, and Faker for data generation. |
| 🧩 | **Modularity**     | High modularity with distinct components for data generation, test file creation, and SQL execution. Facilitates reuse and maintenance. |
| 🧪 | **Testing**        | Uses `pytest` for testing. Specific tests for components are not detailed but likely integrated within the development workflow. |
| ⚡️ | **Performance**    | Performance specifics not detailed, but use of DuckDB suggests efficient handling of SQL queries and datasets. |
| 🛡️ | **Security**       | No explicit security measures detailed. Focus is on testing and data generation rather than secure deployment or data handling. |
| 📦 | **Dependencies**   | Key dependencies include `duckdb`, `pytest`, `Faker`, `typer`, `pyarrow`, `PyYAML`, `sqlglot`, and `black`. |
| 🚀 | **Scalability**    | Scalability is indirectly supported through the use of DuckDB and modular design, allowing for expansion in data size and complexity of SQL queries. |

## 📍 Overview

The project is an asynchronous machine learning inference system designed to handle audio data. It provides a scalable and efficient infrastructure for performing machine learning tasks on audio data, allowing for real-time and batch processing. The system is composed of multiple components including an API for interacting with the system, a client for making requests, and worker modules for performing the machine learning tasks. Its value proposition lies in its ability to process audio data quickly and accurately, enabling applications in areas such as speech recognition, audio classification, and music analysis.

## 📦 Features

|  | Feature             | Description                                                                                            |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️     | **Architecture**    | The repository follows a modular design, with separate directories for the API, client, and workers. It utilizes Docker for containerization and employs FastAPI and Celery for async processing. |
| 📄     | **Documentation**   | The repository lacks extensive documentation, making it challenging to understand its components and functionalities. More detailed explanations and examples would improve its user-friendliness.    |
| 🔗     | **Dependencies**    | Dependencies include FastAPI, Celery, Redis, RabbitMQ, requests, Beautiful Soup, Librosa, Numba, and others. These libraries integrate well to support the repository's async ML inference tasks and web API functionalities.    |
| 🧩     | **Modularity**      | The repository demonstrates modularity with distinct directories for the API, client, and workers. Each component has its own Dockerfile, allowing for isolated development and deployment. |
| 🧪     | **Testing**         | The repository lacks explicit information on testing methodologies. Additional details on unit tests, integration tests, and testing tools would provide insights into the testing practices and coverage. |
| ⚡️     | **Performance**     | Due to the absence of specific details, it is challenging to evaluate the repository's performance. However, the use of async processing with Celery and the utilization of libraries like Librosa and Numba suggest potential for optimized performance. |
| 🔐     | **Security**        | The repository does not provide explicit details on implemented security measures. To ensure data protection and operational integrity, it is recommended to implement secure communication protocols and access controls. |
| 🔀     | **Version Control** | The repository does not specify the version control system used. Implementing a robust version control strategy, such as Git, would facilitate collaborative development and efficient tracking of code changes. |
| 🔌     | **Integrations**    | The repository integrates with RabbitMQ and Redis for message queueing and backend functionality. It also interacts with external APIs using the requests library. These integrations enable efficient communication and interaction between different components. |
| 📶     | **Scalability**     | The repository's modular design, Docker-based containerization, and the use of async processing make it scalable. The deployment can be easily scaled to handle increased user and repository numbers by utilizing appropriate infrastructure management tools. |

The code depends on various libraries and software packages such as Beautiful Soup, Celery, Librosa, and Numba. Its purpose is to enable efficient audio processing and backend functionality.                                                                                                                                         |
| [Dockerfile](https://github.com/FerrariDG/async-ml-inference/blob/main/src/workers/Dockerfile)             | The code snippet is a Dockerfile within the `workers` directory. It sets up a Python 3.7 environment, installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and copies the code into the container. It also exposes ports 6379 and 5672.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [broker.py](https://github.com/FerrariDG/async-ml-inference/blob/main/src/workers/broker.py)               | The `broker.py` file provides functions to get the RabbitMQ connection URL and check if the RabbitMQ broker is running. It uses environment variables to configure the connection parameters. These functions are used to establish and verify the connection with RabbitMQ in the async-ml-inference codebase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

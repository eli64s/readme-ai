It imports the `uuid` library for generating unique identifiers and the `fetchSSE` function from another file `fetch-sse.mjs`. The code sets up a speech recognition instance using the `webkitSpeechRecognition` API and configures it to recognize English language speech continuously. It also sets up a speech synthesis instance using the `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` API for converting text to speech.The code exports functions related to audio processing, such as setting the voice, setting the trigger phrase, enabling/disabling filler words, and testing the voice. It also exports functions for obtaining an access token and making requests to a chat API for getting answers to questions.The code includes event listeners to start/stop the speech recognition, process audio input, and handle errors.

It exports an asynchronous function called `fetchSSE` that takes in a `resource` and `options` parameter. Inside the `fetchSSE` function, it extracts the `onMessage` property from the `options` object, and then makes a fetch request to the `resource` with the provided `fetchOptions`. It creates a parser using the `createParser` function, and sets up an event listener for `event` type messages. Once the fetch response is obtained, it iterates over the response body using the `streamAsyncIterable` function. For each chunk received, it decodes the chunk as a string and feeds it to the parser. If the event from the parser is of type'event', it calls the `onMessage` function with the data from the event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | | [app.css](https://github.com/idosal/assistant-chat-gpt/blob/main/src/content/app.css)                                     | The code represents the CSS file for the application's content section.

With its core functionalities, users can easily create, deploy, and update machine learning models in a serverless environment. By leveraging the power of AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM), Litellm allows developers to define their models using a template file and then deploy them seamlessly. The project\u2019s main value proposition lies in its simplicity and ease of use, enabling developers to focus more on their models\u2019 development and less on the complexities of deployment and management.</p>"},{"location":"examples/archive/readme-litellm/#Features","title":"Features","text":"Feature Description \u2699\ufe0f Architecture The architecture of the project follows a client-server model, with the client implemented in JavaScript and the server implemented in Python using the Flask framework. \ud83d\udcc4 Documentation The project has a README file explaining how to set up and run the system. However, the documentation could benefit from more detailed explanations of the codebase\u2019s functionalities and how to use them. \ud83d\udd17 Dependencies The project relies on various external libraries such as Flask, Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for its server-side implementation. The client-side uses Vue.js, Axios, and Bootstrap. \ud83e\udde9 Modularity The codebase is organized into separate directories for the client and server components. Within each component, the code is modular, with separate files for different functionalities. The modularity allows for easy maintenance and extensibility. \ud83e\uddea Testing The project includes a few unit tests for the server-side code, but there is room for improvement in terms of test coverage. Additionally, frontend testing is not explicitly mentioned in the codebase. \u26a1\ufe0f Performance The system\u2019s performance depends on the hardware resources it is deployed on, but in general, the project has the potential to deliver good performance.

This strategy is used to distribute incoming requests to the least busy deployment.                                                                                                                                                                          | | [least_busy.py](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/blob/main/litellm/router_strategy/least_busy.py)         | The code snippet is a logging handler that tracks the number of requests made to each model deployment, allowing the router to identify the least busy deployment. It logs the number of requests before and after each API call and decrements the count in cache for successful and failed requests. The `get_available_deployments` function uses the request count to select the least busy deployment for a given model group. The code provides support for both synchronous and asynchronous request logging. |   .circleci  | File                                                                                        | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | | ---                                                                                         | ---                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | | [requirements.txt](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/blob/main/.circleci/requirements.txt) | This code snippet is part of a larger repository that follows a structured directory layout.
